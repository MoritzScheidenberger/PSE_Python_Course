  Writing a Story
subtitle: "Understanding the Impact of Uncertainty on Replacement Hiring"
author: "Moritz Scheidenberger"
date-modified: "today"
abstract: "In the labor market, transitions in and out of unemployment are driven by two wheels.
One wheel is the classical cycle of job creation and job destruction. Firms create jobs for which they hire unemployed workers. Simulatenously, some already filled jobs are destroyed and the associated workers become unemployed.
The second wheel is driven by churn. Some already employed workers are hired by another firm and leave behind an empty position which, subsequently, may be filled by another already employed worker who themselves leaves behind a position. So the churn wheel keeps turning until the empty position is filled by a previously unemployed worker.
The conventional view is that models of the labor market model can abstract from the churn wheel when mainly interested in unemployment dynamics. Since job creation must equal job destruction, the number of UE transitions is determined by the EU transitions. EE transitions offset eachother and do not matter for unemploymend dynamics. Yet, disregarding replacement hiring dynamics risks missing essential labor market effects when economic shocks alter firms' quit replacement decisions through mechanisms beyond the usual business cycle impact.
I provide novel evidence that uncertainty shocks directly impact firms' replacement hiring decisions. The reluctance to rehire under uncertainty arises because firms treat existing positions as valuable but sunk investments, leading to a wait-and-see approach."

Now let's take a quick look at the data to know what we are working with and how to proceed.

```{python}
#| label: select_data
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

## Work with the data

# Take a look at all the different variables
df_qwi = load_qwi_data()
if df_qwi is not None:
    print("Column Names (formatted):")
    import textwrap
column_list = " | ".join(df_qwi.columns)
print(textwrap.fill(column_list, width=100))


# Print unique values for specific columns
columns_to_check = ["seasonadj", "geo_level", "ind_level", "industry", "ownercode", "sex", "agegrp",
                    "race", "ethnicity", "education", "firmage", "firmsize"]  # Adjust column names as needed

for col in columns_to_check:
    if col in df_qwi.columns:
        unique_values = ", ".join(map(str, sorted(df_qwi[col].dropna().unique())))
        print(f"{col}: {unique_values}")
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Column '{col}' not found in DataFrame.")

```

Now that we can see the data and know which variables have various cateogries, we can proceed by extracting the time series that we are most interested in.

The variables typically contained in the QWI data follow in a table below:

It turns out that we need to use R (together with python) to use the usual seasonal adjustment with X13-ARIMA.

```{python}
#| label: seasonal_adjustment
#| echo: false
#| warning: false


```



```{python}
#| label: plotting
#| echo: false

# Load the adjusted data
df_qwi_filtered = pd.read_csv("qwi_data_seasadj.csv")

# Clean up by deleting the temp file
os.remove("temp_df.csv")

## Plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot HirAEndRepl over time
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(df_qwi_filtered["date"], df_qwi_filtered["HirAEndRepl"], marker="o", linestyle="-")

# Labels and title
plt.xlabel("Date")
plt.ylabel("HirAEndRepl")
plt.title("Hiring Activity Over Time")

# Improve readability
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()

```
